# Kifu

Kifu is my home-made personal time tracking & invoicing application; written in Python.

![Kifu](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Kifu")

It is highly custom-tailored, so you may not find all the features useful. However; if you are a freelancer issuing time based invoices, you can still benefit from this app. Or; if you are a Python developer, you may fork this application and change according to your own needs. Better than starting from the scratch.

## Preparation

You will find a sample dataset under the folder sample_data.
- Copy those files somewhere safe
- Change constants.json so that DATA_DIR_PATH contains your data path
- Ensure that /config.json points to constants.json
- Change .json files according to your own company structure

## Execution

Simply start main.py in your Python environment.

## Trivia

Kifu is the scoreboard of the ancient game Go. As a freelancer, I found it appropriate to name my time tracker after that. After all, I'm keeping "score" with this app, right?
